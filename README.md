## Description
This mobile app aims to streamline essential travel and booking experiences. As a centralized hub, CheckIt! enables users to manage event check-ins, access booking details, and coordinate itineraries, while also providing a dedicated party messaging system. With these core features, the app simplifies planning and communication, making it perfect for travelers and large parties.

This project is part of my journey to learn mobile app and web development, focusing on React Native, UI/UX designing, and API integration. My goal is to create an intuitive and efficient app while building practical skills in modern app development.
